# SudokuSolver

This is a simple sudoku solver made for a 1st semester computer science exam.
For now it is working very well in a single-threaded solver.

In the future I would like to finish the multi-threaded solver.
Work on this has started, but there is still some bugs to be fixed before this part is working.


It was made solely by Troels Blicher Petersen @ University of Southern Denmark

The program reads simple "sudoku" files. Examples of these are:
<br>test1.sudoku
<br>test2.sudoku
