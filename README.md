# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple sudoku solver made for a 1st semester computer science exam.
For now it is working very well in a single-threaded solver.

In the future I would like to finish the multi-threaded solver.
Work on this has started, but there is still some bugs to be fixed before this part is working.


It was made solely by Troels Blicher Petersen @ University of Southern Denmark

----
The program reads simple "sudoku" files. Examples of these are:
<br>test1.sudoku
<br>test2.sudoku

Feel free do clone, fork or do whatever you will with this piece of software.

Please forgive me that I don't clean up project files from either Eclipse or Intellij. I have kept those for ease of setup from either of these when cloning on a new system.
